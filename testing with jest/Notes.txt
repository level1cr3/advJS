# types of testing.

> Unit testing : in unit testing we test the one unit. like a single function. like sum function or the getLargestFunc. 
                for testing the function that uses api. we use the mock data for api. So we can test the actual code and not worry about
                the api. Pure function are every easy to unit test. because for given the same input they will alway return the same 
                output.

                > these are the most amount of test.



> integration testing : it is similar to unit testing But instead of testing one small unit of work. it is going to be testing 
                        overall general concept. like hey does my entire shopping cart workflow work.
                        example : in integration testing we are going to make the fetch request instead of faking it. we integrating 
                        all these different pieces together.

                        so we are not just testing that whether this function works. we are also whether this function works when it 
                        is communicating with other functions. like when everything comes together is it going to work.

                    > less then unit test and more then end to end test.
                    

 > end to end test : they are similar to manual testing but it is automated. 

                    > you usually have very few end to end test.
